A Python based android app that uses Kivy. 
Buildozer was used to generate the apk file which was then downloaded into the android phone. 
I didn't have much success with the Kivy Launcher, others might be successful. 
I removed the usage of any numpy packages, due to problems created launching the numpy package when the app runs
